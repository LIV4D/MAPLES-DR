MAPLES-DR Dataset
****************************************

**MAPLES-DR** *(MESSIDOR Anatomical and Pathological Labels for Explainable Screening of Diabetic Retinopathy)* is a public dataset which provides annotations 198 fundus images from the public dataset MESSIDOR. For each image, a team of canadian retinologist graded DR (Diabetic Retinopathy) and ME (Macular Eudema), and segmented 10 anatomical and pathological retinal structures. By releasing this dataset, we hope to help the community of AI researcher improve the explainability and reliability of AI models for DR screening.
