  abstract = {Abstract Aims To investigate diabetic retinopathy screening attendance and trends in certified vision impairment caused by diabetic eye disease. Methods This was a retrospective study of attendance in three urban UK diabetic eye screening programmes in England. A survival analysis was performed to investigate time from diagnosis to first screen by age and sex. Logistic regression analysis of factors influencing screening attendance during a 15-month reporting period was conducted, as well as analysis of new vision impairment certifications (Certificate of Vision Impairment) in England and Wales from 2009 to 2019. Results Of those newly registered in the Routine Digital Screening pathway (n = 97 048), 80\% attended screening within the first 12 months and 88\% by 36 months. Time from registration to first eye screening was longer for people aged 18–34 years, and 20\% were unscreened after 3 years. Delay in first screen was associated with increased risk of referable retinopathy. Although 95\% of participants (n = 291 296) attended during the 15-month reporting period, uptake varied considerably. Younger age, social deprivation, ethnicity and duration of diabetes were independent predictors of non-attendance and referable retinopathy. Although the last 10 years has seen an overall reduction in vision impairment certification attributable to diabetic eye disease, the incidence of vision impairment in those aged <35 years was unchanged. Conclusions Whilst the majority of participants are screened in a timely manner, there is considerable variation in uptake. Young adults, have sub-optimal attendance, and levels of vision impairment in this population have not changed over the last 10 years. There is an urgent need to explore barriers to/enablers of attendance in this group to inform policy initiatives and tailored interventions to address this issue.},

  abstract = {Stratified sampling is a sampling method that takes into account the existence of disjoint groups within a population and produces samples where the proportion of these groups is maintained. In single-label classification tasks, groups are differentiated based on the value of the target variable. In multi-label learning tasks, however, where there are multiple target variables, it is not clear how stratified sampling could/should be performed. This paper investigates stratification in the multi-label data context. It considers two stratification methods for multi-label data and empirically compares them along with random sampling on a number of datasets and based on a number of evaluation criteria. The results reveal some interesting conclusions with respect to the utility of each method for particular types of multi-label datasets.},

  abstract = {AIM/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this hypothesis was to examine the association of retinal vessel tortuosity with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: A clinic-based study of 327 participants (224 with diabetes and 103 non-diabetic controls) aged {$\geq$} 18 years. DR was graded from fundus photographs according to the modified Airlie House Classification system and categorised into mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR and vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Retinal vessel tortuosity was measured from disc-centred retinal photographs. Measurements were taken, using a semi-automated computer program by a single grader, of arterioles and venules within 0.5 to 2 disc diameters away from the optic disc. RESULTS: There were 114 (44\%) participants with DR. In the multivariate analysis, retinal arteriolar and venular tortuosity were increased in participants with diabetes without DR (mean difference 12.4 \texttimes{} 10(-5) and 13.3 \texttimes{} 10(-5), respectively; both p {$<$} 0.05) and in those with DR (mean difference 15.4 \texttimes{} 10(-5) and 15.0 \texttimes{} 10(-5), respectively; both p {$<$} 0.01) compared with non-diabetic participants. Among participants with diabetes, increased arteriolar tortuosity was significantly associated with mild NPDR (OR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.03-2.05, per SD increase in arteriolar tortuosity) and moderate NPDR (OR 1.67, 95\% CI 1.10-2.55) but not VTDR (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.54-1.54). No association with DR was found for venular tortuosity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Persons with diabetes had more tortuous retinal vasculature than persons without diabetes. In persons with diabetes, increased arteriolar tortuosity was associated with mild and moderate stages of DR. This suggests that retinal vascular tortuosity might be an early indicator of microvascular damage in diabetes; thus, further investigation is indicated.},

To provide updated estimates on the global prevalence and number of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR) through 2045.
Clinical Relevance
The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated the global population with diabetes mellitus (DM) to be 463 million in 2019 and 700 million in 2045. Diabetic retinopathy remains a common complication of DM and a leading cause of preventable blindness in the adult working population.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus for population-based studies published up to March 2020. Random effect meta-analysis with logit transformation was performed to estimate global and regional prevalence of DR, vision-threatening DR (VTDR), and clinically significant macular edema (CSME). Projections of DR, VTDR, and CSME burden were based on population data from the IDF Atlas 2019.
Results
We included 59 population-based studies. Among individuals with diabetes, global prevalence was 22.27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.73%–25.03%) for DR, 6.17% (95% CI, 5.43%–6.98%) for VTDR, and 4.07% (95% CI, 3.42%–4.82%) for CSME. In 2020, the number of adults worldwide with DR, VTDR, and CSME was estimated to be 103.12 million, 28.54 million, and 18.83 million, respectively; by 2045, the numbers are projected to increase to 160.50 million, 44.82 million, and 28.61 million, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy prevalence was highest in Africa (35.90%) and North American and the Caribbean (33.30%) and was lowest in South and Central America (13.37%). In meta-regression models adjusting for habitation type, response rate, study year, and DR diagnostic method, Hispanics (odds ratio [OR], 2.92; 95% CI, 1.22–6.98) and Middle Easterners (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.51–3.94) with diabetes were more likely to have DR compared with Asians.
Discussion
The global DR burden is expected to remain high through 2045, disproportionately affecting countries in the Middle East and North Africa and the Western Pacific. These updated estimates may guide DR screening, treatment, and public health care strategies.},

abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy ({DR}), the leading cause of blindness for working-age adults, is generally intervened by early screening to reduce vision loss. A series of automated deep-learning-based algorithms for DR screening have been proposed and achieved high sensitivity and specificity ( > 90%). However, these deep learning models do not perform well in clinical applications due to the limitations of the existing publicly available fundus image datasets. In order to evaluate these methods in clinical situations, we collected 13,673 fundus images from 9598 patients. These images were divided into six classes by seven graders according to image quality and DR level. Moreover, 757 images with DR were selected to annotate four types of DR-related lesions. Finally, we evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on collected images, including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Although we obtain an accuracy of 0.8284 for DR classification, these algorithms perform poorly on lesion segmentation and detection, indicating that lesion segmentation and detection are quite challenging. In summary, we are providing a new dataset named DDR for assessing deep learning models and further exploring the clinical applications, particularly for lesion recognition.}
